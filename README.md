Grid/Flexbox practice

From this project I learned:

-More practice with variables

-More practice with different unit size and grid/flexbox synergy

-Box shadow and z-alignment testing

-Seeing a lot more areas where grid is more useful than flexbox. Header probably could've been done a lot easier using grid for instance
